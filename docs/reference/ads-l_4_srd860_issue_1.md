## SUBPART A - GENERAL

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.A.1 Introduction

This document is the initial technical specification of ADS-L transmissions using SDR860 frequency band for aircraft to become electronically conspicuous to U-space Service Providers (USSPs). It is intended for manufacturers interested to develop ADS-L compliant e-Conspicuity device/system.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.A.2 Background

On April 21st 2021, the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/666 was published, amending SERA.6005 by the sub-article (c):

```
    Manned aircraft operating in airspace designated by the competent
authority as a U-space airspace, and not provided with an air traffic control
  service by the ANSP, shall continuously make themselves electronically
               conspicuous to the U-space service providers.
```

On December 16, 2021, EASA further published NPA 2021-14: “Development of acceptable means of compliance and guidance material to support the U-space regulation” (“AMC/GM”). Section 3.3 introduced in more detail the AMC and GM for implementing above SERA.6005 (c) article. AMC1 SERA.6005(c) in point (a)(3)(ii) specifies SRD-860 frequency band as one of the three means of transmission of electronic conspicuity information. Appendix 1 to AMC1 SERA.6005(c) further specifies ADS-L MESSAGE GENERATION FUNCTION i.e. the minimum set of parameters that should be transmitted and a set of parameters that may be transmitted optionally, termed “ADS-L” thereafter.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.A.3 Scope

The technical specification is intended to be a complete and accurate description of ADS-L, including physical layer, timing details, data semantics, byte packaging and so forth. It does not cover other aspects of a practical system for electronic conspicuity, such as: User interface, configuration, error handling, software upgrades and so forth. It is open to any interested party for implementation. In some of the definitions, C code snippets are used. These snippets are intended to provide easy-to-adopt examples. The snippets are hardware-agnostic and fully portably. The code follows the ANSI C99 standard and assume a standard integer width of 32 bits. More formal descriptions will be added later.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.A.4 Qualification System

There is no ETSO or MOPS for ADS-L at the time of writing of this specification. Responsibility for the compliance with SERA.6005(is ultimately with the operator of the aircraft in which an ADS-L system is being operated. A statement of “Non Technical Objection (NTO)” may optionally be obtained by the manufacturers from EASA to confirm to aircraft operators that the device/system is credible for this intended function in compliance with SERA.6005(c).

## SUBPART B - OVERVIEW

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.B.1 Block Diagram

A typical implementation block diagram is given below. The implementation consists of at least:

```
●       GNSS receiver for 3D localization and timing,

●       Host processor

●       RF frontend, capable of transmitting RF signals.
```

In this setup, the processing of the eID protocol happens in the host processor. Alternative setups use an SoC for RF and protocol processing in one package, or implement a standalone eID transmitter.

```
                    Host
GNSS                                       RF
                  Processor
```

In addition to the specifications given in here, all transmissions must comply with local regulations.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.B.2 Protocol Architecture

ADS-L is a lightweight, stateless, undirected broadcast protocol. It loosely follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 OSI model using layers 1, 2, and 6 (see below, red).

```
Layer 7: Application

Layer 6: Presentation

Layer 5: Session

Layer 4: Transport

Layer 3: Network

Layer 2: Data Link

Layer 1: Physical
```

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.B.3 Bit and Byte Order

The following principles apply unless noted otherwise.

```
   Byte size: A byte consists of 8 bits. The least significant bit has a weight of 0x01, while the most
    significant bit has a weight of 0x80 (128 decimal).

   Byte order: Little Endian byte order is used throughout. That is, integers are transmitted on the
    RF least significant byte first. The data is assumed to be stored in the memory in the same order.

   Bit order: Individual bytes are transmitted most significant bit first.
```

Example: The integer 1328922 (0x14471A) is transmitted as 0x1A, 0x47, 0x14 on the radio (from left to right). The exact bit sequence on the RF is: 00011010, 01000111, 00010100 (again left to right).Note: SC- CS005() refers to the installation of ADS-B OUT equipment.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.B.4 Transmission Sequence

All data is sent in discrete packets, the size of which is determined by the payload size. The structure of a packet is indicated below.

```
Preamble         Sync Word          Payload           CRC         Signature

                                                                                 time
```

Note the signature (blue) is optional; its presence must be indicated in the header (see Subpart D). The payload is further structured by the various layers of the ADS-L protocol.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.B.4 Future Development

The protocol may evolve and change in future. Implementations shall always be consistent with the standard version designated in the “Protocol version” field in the messages. Once new versions become available, old versions will be deprecated during a phase-over period. Implementers shall switch to the latest version in reasonable time.

## SUBPART C - PHYSICAL LAYER

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.1 Introduction

Two physical systems are supported by ADS-L: M-band3 operating in the 868. .. 868.6 MHz spectrum, and O-band operating in the 869.4 .. 869.65 spectrum. These band differ substantially in allowable duty cycle and power, as well as the expected level of interference. Both bands also have a different set of legacy systems operating therein, whose modulation parameters are to be adopted by ADS-L as best as possible. Different modulation schemes are thus employed for each band.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.2 M-Band

A digital modulation scheme (2-GFSK) is employed to transmit data. The key parameters are given in the table below.

```
Frequency                                          868.2 MHz, 868.4 MHz

Channel Bandwidth                                  200 kHz

Modulation                                         GFSK

Max. Power (ERP)                                   14 dBm / 25 mW

Chip rate                                          100 kbps
                                                   Effective bitrate is halved due to Manchester
                                                   encoding

Frequency Deviation                                0: -50 kHz, 1: +50 kHz

Gauss Filter BT                                    0.5

Backoff Interval (see Subpart D)                   15 ms .. 250 ms
```

The frequencies of the M-band are used: 868.2 and 868.4 MHz. An ADS-L sender shall alternate between these frequencies for every transmission to allow better usage of the frequency spectrum.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.2.1 Manchester Encoding

Manchester encoding is applied to the Sync Word, Payload, and CRC for better clock synchronization (lower error rate and more reliable transmission), halving the effective bit rate to 50kbps. Manchester encoding is not applied to the Preamble, see below. The encoding is such that a ‘1’ is encoded as ‘01’ and a ‘0’ as ‘10’.

_____________________ 3 See EN 300 220-2 for a definition of both bands

If the (optional) secure signature is used, Manchester encoding is disabled for transmitting it to enable a shorter on-air time. This means the transmitter shall switch to non-Manchester mode after transmitting the CRC. See the next section on the ADS-L packet structure.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.2.3 Preamble

The Preamble is sent by the transmitter to allow eligible receivers to synchronize their clocks. It consists of two parts:

```
1.       A sequence of zeroes and ones of at least length 10 symbols, maximum 24 symbols. The
         sequence shall end with a 1, and
2.       the sequence 1001, transmitted twice.
```

Manchester encoding is not applied to the Preamble. The shortest valid preamble thus is (sent from left to right): 01 0101 0101 1001 1001.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.2.4 Sync Word

The Sync Word is 2 bytes, each transmitted with the most significant bit first. The Sync Word content is given below as arrays, transmitted left to right. Manchester encoding is to be applied to the Sync Word before sending.

```
Hex                                                 0x72 0x4B

Binary                                              01110010 01001011
```

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.3 O-Band

A digital modulation scheme (2-GFSK) is employed to transmit data. The key parameters are given in the table below.

```
Frequency                                             869.525 MHz

Channel Bandwidth                                     250 kHz

Modulation                                            GFSK

Max. Power (ERP)                                      27d Bm / 500 mW

Chip rate                                             38.4 kbps

Frequency Deviation                                   0: -10 kHz, 1: +10k Hz

Backoff Interval (see Subpart D)                      10 ms .. 50 ms
```

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.3.2 Preamble

The Preamble is sent by the transmitter to allow eligible receivers to synchronize their clocks. It consists of a sequence of 10 bytes 0xAA

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.C.3.1 Sync Word

The Sync Word is 2 bytes, each transmitted with the most significant bit first. The Sync Word content is given below as arrays, transmitted left to right.

```
Hex       0x2D 0xD4
```

Binary 0010 1101 1101 0100

```
Hex                                               0x2D 0xD4

Binary                                            0010 1101 1101 0100
```

## SUBPART D - DATA LINK LAYER

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.1 Data Link Frame Structure

The data link layer governs the following aspects of the protocol:  Mediating access to the RF channel for maximum scalability and fairness  Ensuring data integrity by means of adding a cyclic redundancy check.  Optionally, authenticating the message by adding a secure signature

The structure of the data link frame is given as:

```
Offset                        Description       Width (bits)      Encoding

0                             Packet Length     8                 Length of the packet in bytes,
                                                                  excluding this field and
                                                                  excluding the signature (if
                                                                  present)

8                             Data              (Packet           See Subpart F
                                                Length - 3) *
                                                8

(Packet Length + 1) *         CRC               24                Redundancy check
```

8

```
(Packet Length + 3) *         Secure            512               Optional
8                             Signature
```

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.1.1 Packet Length

This field contains the number of bytes of the full message including the header, payload, and CRC, but excluding the length field itself, and the signature. Some payload types have variable lengths, in which case this field must be consulted to determine the true payload length.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.1.2 CRC

A 24-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for message integrity is transmitted after the Payload. The CRC is to be computed over the entire ADS-L packet, excluding the Packet Length field and the Secure Signature. The CRC code is identical to the one used in Mode-S and 1090 MHz ADS-B. The generator polynomial is thus given by:

```
G(x) = x24 + x23 + x22 + x21 + x20 + x19 + x18 + x17 +
      x16 + x15 + x14 + x13 + x12 + x10 + x3 + 1
```

A sample implementation is given below: static uint32_t _crc24_polypass(uint32_t crc, uint8_t input) { const uint32_t poly = 0xFFFA0480;

crc |= input; for (uint8_t bit = 0; bit < 8; bit++) { if (crc & 0x80000000)

```
crc ^= poly;
```

crc <<= 1; } return crc; }

uint32_t crc24(const uint8_t *data, size_t len_data) { uint32_t crc = 0; for (size_t idx = 0; idx < len_data; idx++) { crc = _crc24_polypass(crc, data[idx]); } crc = _crc24_polypass(crc, 0); crc = _crc24_polypass(crc, 0); crc = _crc24_polypass(crc, 0); return crc >> 8; }

Note that only the 3 lower bytes of the result are relevant and to be transmitted on the RF in Big endian, i.e. most significant byte first.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.1.3 Secure Signature

Implementing devices may optionally digitally sign the transmitted data packets using a secure public-key digital signature algorithm to improve the trustworthiness of their transmission. The private key shall be stored securely on the device and be protected against all reading. Only the associated public key may ever be exposed. A device may implement automatic creation of a new public key, e.g. by means of a true random number generator. The digital signature links a physical device, represented by its secret private key, to a real entity (legal or natural). This relationship is typically stored in a certificate authority (CA), operated e.g. by the competent authority. CA and other infrastructure are outside the scope of this document. The secure signature is optionally appended to the payloads after the message checksum (CRC). Simple receivers may thus only receive messages while ignoring the signature. The signature is optional. If used, it shall be appended at most every 10 seconds, at least every 30 seconds. The algorithm is the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), specifically the Ed25519 variant as described in IRTF/IETF RFC 8032. The public key is 256 bits, the signature is 512bits in compressed form 4 . The algorithm takes the ADS-L Messages including header and payload as input, but excluding the CRC. If message scrambling / encryption is used, then the input shall be used after encryption.

_____________________ 4 IRTF RFC 8032, https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.3 Transmit Rate and Transmit Timing

The standard message transmit rate is once every second whenever. Devices may optionally transmit with less frequency based on the pattern of motion, the spectrum usage, or energy considerations. The minimum nominal transmission rate is once per 5 seconds. Data packets shall be discarded if the total delay of 1000ms from obtaining the GNSS fix is exceeded, e.g. due to the frequency being occupied, to prevent old data being sent.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.D.4 Media Access

The MAC protocol to be used is 1-persistent Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA). Listen-before-talk (LBT) must be implemented according to the Polite Spectrum Access rules laid out in ETSI EN 300 220-1. Devices must sense for an existing carrier before transmitting. If a carrier is detected, transmission of the packet shall be delayed (backoff). Devices shall retry transmission after a random delay, distributed uniformly in the backoff interval as defined in Subpart C, depending on the band in use. If no packet can be transmitted 3000 ms after the initial attempt, the device may force transmission irrespective of carrier detect. After a forced transmission, the device may not transmit for at least 2000 ms.

## SUBPART E - NETWORK LAYER

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.E.1 Network Packet Structure

The network layer governs the following aspects of the ADS-L protocol:  A payload length field is included for easy interoperability with inexpensive, discrete FSK transceiver

```
systems
```

 Protocol versioning, such that newer versions of the protocol can be safely deployed  The addition of the secure signature is indicated here  Data scrambling, improving the resilience to transmission errors.

The network packet structure is given as:

```

                                                  8
```

The individual fields are further explained below.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.E.1.1 Protocol Version

Shall be set to 0 to indicate this version of the ADS-L protocol specification is being used for transmission. Future versions of ADS-L shall keep the position of this field relative to the ADS-L packet constant such that a receiver shall always first check this field to determine further processing and parsing.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.E.1.2 Secure Signature Flag

If set to 1, the Secure Signature shall be added after the CRC, see above.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.E.1.3 Key Index

This field indicates with key is used for the encryption / scrambling of the header and payload. By default, key 0 is used and given by:

```
key0                                                         0x00000000
```

Key indices 1 through 3 are reserved.

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.E.2 Encryption / Data Scrambling

The data portion is encrypted to ensure message integrity, system safety and provide protection for the relevant content against eavesdropping, namely by article 3 of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and Directive 2013/40/EU. The XXTEA symmetric encryption algorithm with 6 rounds shall be used. The algorithmic network of the cipher is given below. An example C implementation is also given below. The required parameters are indicated in the table below.

The part of the packet to be scrambled/encrypted with XXTEA shall be a multiple of four bytes as XXTEA works on 32-bit words. If only for data scrambling, the XXTEA can be calculated with encryption key being all-zeros (this simplifies the code and has been checked to work) and the more fields are taken for it the more protection there is for those. Scrambling enables an additional verification check as the scrambled packet content is sensitive to single bit errors which become immediately noticeable and they make the packet look pseudo-random. noticeable and they make the packet look pseudo-random.

## SUBPART F - PRESENTATION LAYER

### ADS-L.4.SRD860.F.1 ADS-L Data

The Presentation Layer builds on top of the Network Layer, adding the concrete ADS-L functions. It identifies the sender and provides a means to enumerate the concrete payload type. The data layout of the ADS-L data is given as:

```
Offset           Description              Width (bits)                  Encoding

0                ADS-L Header             40                            See below

40               ADS-L Payload            Variable, must be             Variable
                                          multiple of 32
```

Currently, only the iConspicuity5 payload type is described in this document. As ADS-L aims to be extensible, further payload types may be added in the future.

8            Base address                           16
```

Manufacturers intending to implement ADS-L shall apply for a unique manufacturer prefix, associated to one of the manufacturer pages of the AMT. The combination AMT page + manufacturer prefix shall be uniquely assigned to only one manufacturer. The manufacturer shall use the remaining 16-bit base address space as densely as possible. Once the range is used up, the manufacturer shall apply for a new AMT page + manufacturer prefix combination to use.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.F.2.3 Privacy Mode

In order to not disclose its identity, a device may be operated in privacy mode. In this mode, the address is selected randomly. Privacy mode is activated by selecting entry 0 of the AMT. The sender shall randomly and uniformly select manufacturer prefix and base address at device start-up. This random address shall not change while the device is operated. Toggling between privacy and normal modes during flight is not admissible.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.F.2.4 Payload

The payload structure and semantics are defined by the Payload Type Identifier. Individual payloads are defined below. Any new payload (i.e. not defined herein) must be approved by the governing body before using it. Any new payload shall be of a size appropriate for encryption, i.e. 5 + (payload size in bytes) must be divisible by four. Valid payload size thus are: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.5 Latitude and Longitude

The WGS-84 reference system is used throughout. The position expressed in degrees latitude and longitude, respectively. Both components are encoded as 24-bit signed integers. The least significant bit for the latitude is 1° / 93206; for longitude 1° / 46603. North and East are positive, respectively. A special value of 0xFFFFFF is used to indicate a lack of a position fix.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.6 Exponential Encoding

The following fields use exponential encoding with varying bit sizes. The two leading bits of the encoded value are used as a scaling exponent, allowing for a much larger value range to be encoded, while keeping high accuracy around zero. Exponential encoding is used for unsigned (altitude, ground speed) and signed (vertical rate) fields. For unsigned fields, the exponent is shifted one bit to the right, using the (now free) leading bit as a sign bit. The layout of an encoded unsigned value thus is:

```
<exponent:2> <base:N>
```

Where the number after the colon indicates the number of bits occupied by this field. For signed values, the layout becomes:

```
<sign:1> <exponent:2> <base:N>
```

Note that N is derived from the total width of the field, e.g. N=6 for Ground speed and N=6 for Vertical rate. Given an unsigned encoded value consisting of exponent and base, the decoded value is given by

```
value = 2exponent*(2N + base) – 2N
```

For signed encoded values, the sign field shall indicate that the decoded value is negative, i.e. the above result multiplied by -1. For encoding unsigned values, the following algorithm shall be used: 1. Find the largest e* from the set (0, 1, 2, 3) such that value >= 2N+e* – 2N 2. Return exponent = e*, base = value - 2N+e* – 2N For encoding signed values, the sign bit shall be set if value is negative. Exponent and base shall be computed as above using abs(value) as input. A value of 0 shall always be encoded as non-negative, i.e. the sign bit shall be cleared. In addition to the exponential encoding, the fields use a scaling factor and – the altitude – an offset. These parameters are indicated below.

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.7 Altitude above WGS-84 Ellipsoid

The resolution of the encoding is 1m. An offset of 320m is added to encode negative altitudes. Exponential (unsigned) encoding is used with 2 bits for the exponent and 12 bits for the base. The minimum encodable altitude is -320 m, the maximum is 61112 m. Examples:

```

61112 m                                                              0x3fff
```

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.8 Ground Speed

The resolution for encoding ground speed is 0.25 m/s. Exponential (unsigned) encoding is used with 2 bits for the exponent and 6 bits for the base. The maximum encodable ground speed is 238 m/s. Examples:

```

```

#### ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.9 Vertical Rate

The resolution is 0.125 m/s. Exponential signed encoding is used with 1 bit for the sign, 2 bits for the exponent, and 6 bits for the base. Positive values shall indicate an upward motion (away from Earth). The minimum and maximum encodable values are -119 m/s and +119 m/s, respectively. Examples:

```
