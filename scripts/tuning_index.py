"""Generate docs/TUNING.md: every number the firmware's behavior is tuned by.

Nothing here is authored twice. The constants are read out of the sources by
`tuning_constants.py`, the same parse `check_tuning_names.py` holds to the
vocabulary, and the reason beside each one is the comment already above it. A
folder's README is linked rather than quoted: the argument for a threshold is
prose, and prose belongs next to the code it defends.

The index exists because these numbers are the device's behavior and they are
spread over forty files on purpose. One view of the whole surface is worth
having; one home for the values would leave every one of them without its
paragraph.

Every constant the firmware's behavior is tuned by: what the device claims about
itself, what the glass says, what goes on the air, and how often. Generated from
the sources by `scripts/tuning_index.py`, so a value that changes without its
note changing is a red build.

The names read `k<Subject><Mechanism><Unit>`, and
[`firmware/README.md`](../firmware/README.md) is where the mechanisms are
defined: a hold, a settle, a floor and a period are four different things that
all read as "a delay" in conversation.

Out of scope, deliberately: `firmware/hardware/`, `firmware/boards/` and
`firmware/ports/`. Those figures come from datasheets, under the datasheet's
name. Anything a pilot can change is a setting rather than a tuning, and lives
in `firmware/products/skyblip_go/settings.h`.
