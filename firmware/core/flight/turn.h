// core/flight/turn.h: how fast a track is swinging, from two reported tracks
// and the gap between them. Own-ship differentiates its own GNSS track for the
// six-pack and for the extrapolation the transmitter applies; the alarm
// differentiates a target's track history to tell a gaggle from a collision
// course. Same arithmetic, two callers, one place: cordic9 is 512 units to the
// turn and the difference has to be taken the short way round, or a heading
// that crosses north reads as a 358 deg/s reversal.
