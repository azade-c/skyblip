# Reference specifications

Normative sources the firmware is written against, kept locally so a clause citation in `docs/BEHAVIOR.md` or a comment in `firmware/core/protocol/` can be checked without a network round trip.

Both issues are published by EASA as attachments to [ED Decision 2022/024/R](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/agency-decisions/ed-decision-2022024r). The firmware targets Issue 2; Issue 1 is here because deployed hardware and most third-party implementations predate Issue 2, and the two differ in the payload set and in Subpart C.

## ADS-L 4 SRD-860 Issue 2

The one the firmware implements. 52 pages, dated 1 December 2025. Adds the Status, Traffic Uplink, FIS-B and Remote Identification payloads, and the O-band LDR/HDR split, to Issue 1's Traffic payload.

## ADS-L 4 SRD-860 Issue 1

30 pages, dated 20 December 2022, titled "Technical Specification for ADS-L transmissions using SRD-860 frequency band". Its Subpart G names the position payload "iConspicuity", which Issue 2 renames "Traffic".

## The conformance suite

Issue 2 is read clause by clause by [`firmware/test/adsl/`](../../firmware/test/adsl), one file per subpart, every case named after the clause it checks: `ADS-L.4.SRD860.G.1.7: the altitude encodes the clause's worked examples`. Every heading of the document has a case, including the clauses this firmware does not satisfy, which are written as the clause requires and skipped over a `TODO:` naming the gap.

`scripts/check_adsl_clauses.py` is what keeps the two lists equal: it reads the clause headings out of the markdown beside this file and the case subjects out of the suite, and fails on either a clause nobody read or a case naming a clause that does not exist. The suite's own README says how a gap is written.

## The conversions

Each `.md` is generated, for grepping and quoting, never edited by hand:

```
pdftotext -layout docs/reference/ads-l_4_srd860_issue_2.pdf /tmp/spec.txt
python3 scripts/spec_to_md.py /tmp/spec.txt docs/reference/ads-l_4_srd860_issue_2.md
```

`scripts/spec_to_md.py` drops page furniture and the table of contents, promotes `SUBPART` and `ADS-L.4.SRD860.x.y` lines to headings, joins wrapped paragraphs, and fences every column-aligned block verbatim. Tables keep the PDF's spacing inside those fences rather than becoming markdown tables: the field-offset tables lose their alignment otherwise. Figures and block diagrams are not carried over.

The PDF is the normative text. Where the two disagree, the PDF wins.
