// core/annunciation/pattern.h: what the buzzer should be doing right now.
//
// One decision, in one place. The traffic tracker says which level stands and
// whether it just got worse; this says how that sounds - on times, off times,
// how many, and how often it is said again - and it is the only thing allowed
// to hand the buzzer from one voice to another. ports::Annunciator::alarm() opens
// a continuous tone that runs until silence(), so a level with no off time is a
// level that never stops: every pattern here ends by itself.
//
// INFO: al 02aug26 the pair is SoftRF's fork's look cadence (oss/SoftRF-moshe-braner
// Buzzer.cpp:172-215)
