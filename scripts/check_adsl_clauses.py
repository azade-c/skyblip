"""Fail if a clause of ADS-L 4 SRD-860 issue 2 has no case in firmware/test/adsl/.

The clause list is the specification's own: every `ADS-L.4.SRD860.x.y` heading in
docs/reference/ads-l_4_srd860_issue_2.md. The suite's list is the subject of every
TEST_CASE in firmware/test/adsl/, which reads `ADS-L.4.SRD860.x.y: what holds`.

The two must match exactly. A clause the firmware does not implement still gets a
case, written as the clause requires and marked doctest::skip() over a TODO: the
gap is then stated in the suite rather than missing from it. A subject that names
no clause is a typo, and a clause with no case is a hole in the reading.
